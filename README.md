# Ensemble-Machine-Learning
Automatic medical document classification using machine learning techniques can enhance the productivity of healthcare services by reducing processing time and cost. This work proposes an ensemble learning approach to develop a 
model that classifies electronic medical documents in Afaan Oromo. The main tasks in this work are preparing the corpus, pre-processing, training the models, and the classification process. We used the term frequency-inverse document 
frequency (TF-IDF) and bag of words (BOW) feature extraction methods. An ensemble technique in this work is that it 
creates multiple individual classifier predictions from naïve Bayes, random forest, SVM, and logistic regression and then 
combines them to advance a reliable and more accurate classifier. Evaluation measures were employed using accuracy, 
F1-score, recall, and precision for performance comparison. The efficiency of the proposed method is compared with 
the two existing boosting approaches, namely gradient boosting and adaboost.

#**Article Highlights**
• Introduce ensemble learning techniques for efficient classification of medical documents in Afaan Oromo
• These ensemble techniques combine the predictions of utilized base learner and apply the voting methods to 
obtain the improved final prediction model.
• The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble method by achieving 94.81% accuracy

**#The contributions of the proposed works are:**
• Develop labeled Afaan Oromo medical documents with the help of domain experts, which is helpful for other 
works in this domain.
• Propose a method of an ensemble learning model for Afaan Oromo medical text automatic classification
• The comparative analysis of feature extraction methods for each of the models has been done using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bag of Word.
Comparative analysis of the proposed ensemble learning model and boosting algorithms has been done.
• The performance analysis showed that the proposed model improves the performance of individual classifers

In this paper, the researcher used a single ML such as NB, RF, SVM, and logistic regression as baseline models and booting approaches like Adaboost and Gradient Boosting classifiers for the purpose of result comparison with the proposed model (combination of baseline models).
