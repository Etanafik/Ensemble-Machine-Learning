# Ensemble-Machine-Learning
Automatic medical document classifcation using machine learning techniques can enhance the productivity of healthcare services by reducing processing time and cost. This work proposes an ensemble learning approach to develop a 
model that classifes electronic medical documents in Afaan Oromo. The main tasks in this work are preparing the corpus, pre-processing, training the models, and the classifcation process. We used the term frequency-inverse document 
frequency (TF-IDF) and bag of words (BOW) feature extraction methods. An ensemble technique in this work is that it 
creates multiple individual classifer predictions from naïve Bayes, random forest, SVM, and logistic regression and then 
combines them to advance a reliable and more accurate classifer. Evaluation measures were employed using accuracy, 
F1-score, recall, and precision for performance comparison. The efciency of the proposed method is compared with 
the two existing boosting approaches, namely gradient boosting and adaboost.

Article Highlights
• Introduce ensemble learning techniques for efcient classifcation of medical document in Afaan Oromo
• These ensemble techniques combine the predictions of utilized base learner and applied the voting methods to 
obtain the improved fnal prediction model.
• The results demonstrate the efectiveness of the proposed ensemble method by achieving 94.81% accuracy

The contributions of the proposed works are:
• Develop labeled Afaan Oromo medical documents with the help of domain experts, which is helpful for other 
works in this domain.
• Propose a method of ensemble learning model for Afaan Oromo medical text automatic classification
• The comparative analysis of feature extraction methods for each of the models has been done using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bag of Word.
Comparative analysis of the proposed ensemble learning model and boosting algorithms has been done.
• The performance analysis showed that the proposed model improves the performance of individual classifers
